# Report SuperPy


The SuperPy project is a command-line tool designed to assist a large supermarket chain in managing their inventory. It provides a range of functionalities to track and report various aspects of the supermarket's product inventory. The tool allows users to perform operations such as buying and selling products, generating inventory reports, and managing dates to simulate time-based scenarios.

The core functionality of this project revolves around storing and retrieving product information from CSV files. The `products.csv` file maintains details like product names, buy prices, and expiration dates. The `inventory.csv` file tracks the current count of each product in the inventory, while the `sales.csv` file records the sales transactions. This structured data storage enables efficient data management and retrieval. 

One of the standout features of SuperPy is its ability to manipulate time. By utilizing the `--advance-time` option, users can simulate the passage of time by specifying the number of days to advance. This time manipulation feature proves valuable for testing and simulating different scenarios within the supermarket's inventory management system. 

The command-line interface is implemented using the argparse module, allowing users to interact with SuperPy through intuitive commands and options. The tool provides detailed help messages and error handling to ensure smooth user experience.

This project offers various reporting capabilities, including generating inventory reports, revenue reports, and profit reports. The inventory reports display product information such as name, count, buy price, and expiration date. Revenue reports provide insights into daily and historical revenue, while profit reports calculate the profit for a given period.

Overall, SuperPy is a comprehensive command-line tool that provides efficient inventory management functionality for a large supermarket chain. By utilizing its features, users can effectively track product information, manage inventory levels, and generate insightful reports. The ability to manipulate time adds a valuable dimension to the tool, making it suitable for testing and simulating real-world
scenarios.
